=======
jsonrpc
=======

Support for json rpc 2.0 based on http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification.
Comes with unit tests.

Requirements
============
- **Node** (for unit tests)


Commands
========
``make clean``  = remove build

``make``        = make clean, compile coffee sources

``make test``   = play unit tests
Note: *When test are runned, output will be in your flashlog.txt file. You can change this behavior easily via inheritance or a simple function allocation*

``make deploy`` = publish master on gh-pages branch

Example
=======

::

  req = '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "sum", "params": [1, 2, 4], "id": 1}'

  services =
    sum: (a, args...) ->
      for i in args then a += i
      a

  res = JSONRPC.handleRequest(req, services)

  console.log res
  // displays {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": 7, "id": "1"}



Folder architecture
===================

**src**     = raw sources  

**build**   = compiled source
